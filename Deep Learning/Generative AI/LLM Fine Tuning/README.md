# Sentiment Analysis with GPT-2

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a GPT-2 model for sentiment analysis using Hugging Face's `transformers` library. The model is trained to classify the sentiment of tweets into three categories: positive, neutral, and negative. The training process includes utilizing mixed precision to manage memory efficiently and enhance computational performance.

## Problem Statement
Accurate sentiment analysis of social media posts is crucial for understanding public opinion, improving customer service, and making data-driven decisions. This project addresses this need by developing a model that can reliably classify the sentiment of tweets.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Tweet Sentiment Extraction" dataset from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). The dataset consists of tweets labeled with their sentiment:
- **Train set**: 27,481 tweets
- **Test set**: 3,534 tweets

## Models Used
- **GPT-2**: The pre-trained GPT-2 model is fine-tuned for sequence classification to detect sentiment in tweets.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Hugging Face Datasets

## Learning Objectives
The primary objectives of this project include:
- Understanding and implementing fine-tuning of a pre-trained language model for sentiment analysis.
- Applying tokenization and data preprocessing techniques.

## Approach and Methodology
The project follows these steps:
1. **Data Preparation**: Loading and tokenizing the dataset using Hugging Face's `datasets` and `transformers` libraries.
2. **Model Training**: Fine-tuning the GPT-2 model with mixed precision to classify tweet sentiments.
3. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance on the test set and classifying new tweets to demonstrate its capabilities.

## Model Performance    
The performance of the fine-tuned model is evaluated using standard accuracy metrics. The model is also tested on sample tweets to demonstrate its practical application.

## Impact
Accurate sentiment analysis can significantly benefit various industries by providing insights into public opinion, enhancing customer service, and enabling data-driven decision-making.

## Future Enhancements
Future enhancements and experiments to improve model performance and application include:

- Fine-tuning on a larger and more diverse dataset.
- Exploring other pre-trained models for better accuracy.
- Integrating real-time sentiment analysis for dynamic applications.
