# Satellite Image to Maps Translation

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a generative AI model for translating satellite images to maps. The project is based on the research paper titled "Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks," which can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004).

## Introduction

This project aims to leverage the power of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for translating satellite images into maps. The inspiration for this work comes from the foundational research presented in the paper "Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks."
