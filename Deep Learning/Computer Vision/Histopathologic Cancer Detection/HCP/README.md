# Histopathologic Cancer Detection

## Overview

Histopathologic Cancer Detection is a machine learning project aimed at identifying metastatic cancer in small image patches extracted from larger digital pathology scans. The project utilizes a modified version of the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset sourced from Kaggle. This dataset is specifically curated for the clinically-relevant task of metastasis detection, making it an ideal playground for exploring deep learning, computer vision, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Problem Statement

The early detection of metastatic cancer is crucial for improving patient outcomes and treatment efficacy. This project addresses this challenge by creating an algorithm capable of accurately classifying pathology images as either cancerous or non-cancerous.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a modified version of the PCam benchmark dataset available on Kaggle. The modifications eliminate duplicate images, ensuring a clean and reliable dataset for training and evaluation. This dataset is well-suited for research and development in the field of machine learning, providing a balance between task difficulty and tractability.
