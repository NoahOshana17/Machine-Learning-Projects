# Histopathologic Cancer Detection

## Overview

Histopathologic Cancer Detection is a machine learning project aimed at identifying metastatic cancer in small image patches extracted from larger digital pathology scans. The project utilizes a modified version of the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset sourced from Kaggle. This dataset is specifically curated for the clinically-relevant task of metastasis detection, making it an ideal playground for exploring deep learning, computer vision, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Problem Statement

The early detection of metastatic cancer is crucial for improving patient outcomes and treatment efficacy. This project addresses this challenge by creating an algorithm capable of accurately classifying pathology images as either cancerous or non-cancerous.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a modified version of the PCam benchmark dataset available on Kaggle. The modifications eliminate duplicate images, ensuring a clean and reliable dataset for training and evaluation. This dataset is well-suited for research and development in the field of machine learning, providing a balance between task difficulty and tractability.

## Impact on Healthcare

The integration of AI technology into pathology has the potential to revolutionize cancer diagnosis and treatment, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes. The following are just a few examples on how this technology can impact the healthcare industry:

1. Improved Diagnosis Accuracy: AI algorithms can assist pathologists in accurately detecting metastatic cancer in pathology images, reducing the likelihood of missed diagnoses or misinterpretations.
2. Cost Savings: Through improved efficiency and accuracy, AI-powered pathology analysis has the potential to reduce healthcare costs associated with diagnostic procedures and treatments.
3. Extended Reach: AI technology can help bridge the gap in access to specialized expertise, particularly in regions with limited resources or where there is a shortage of pathologists.
4. Enhanced Efficiency: By automating parts of the diagnostic process, AI can streamline workflows, allowing pathologists to focus their time and expertise on more complex cases or other critical tasks.

## Future Enhancements

This notebook goes through a basic process of model training and development using transfer learning. There are future enhancements and experiments we can try to further improve our model performance:

1. Dataset Manipulation: There are many strategies we can look into and leverage to possibly improve our model. This includes further image augmentations, class sampling (over sampling, under sampling, SMOTE, etc), and many more.
2. Model Adjustments: Hyperparamter tuning, additional model architectures, adjusting trainable model layers, etc.
