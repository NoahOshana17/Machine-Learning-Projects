    "<p>Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for approximately 17.9 million deaths annually, which constitutes about 31% of all global deaths. In the U.S. alone, it accounts for around 697,000 deaths each year, making it the leading cause of mortality. With an estimated 20.1 million adults aged 20 and older having Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), heart disease is a significant public health issue. Key risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity, and an unhealthy diet. Men are generally at higher risk at a younger age, but womenâ€™s risk increases after menopause, making heart disease the leading cause of death among women as well. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Preventing heart disease involves adopting a heart-healthy lifestyle. This includes eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats while reducing saturated fats, trans fats, salt, and added sugars. Regular physical activity, such as at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week combined with strength training, is crucial. Maintaining a healthy weight, particularly by managing abdominal fat, plays a vital role in prevention.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Avoiding tobacco use is essential, as smoking is a major cause of coronary artery disease, and exposure to secondhand smoke also increases risk. Limiting alcohol consumption to moderate levels, practicing stress management techniques, and ensuring 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night are important for heart health. Regular health screenings for blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes help detect and manage risk factors early, while adherence to prescribed medications can further reduce risk. Staying informed about your family history and current heart health guidelines allows for proactive prevention. Integrating these practices into daily life can significantly lower the chances of developing heart disease and improve overall health.</p>"
