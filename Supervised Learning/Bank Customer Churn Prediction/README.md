# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
Bank Customer Churn Prediction is a supervised machine learning project focused on predicting whether customers of a U.S. bank will leave the bank or not. The project utilizes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques and XGBoost Classifier model for making predictions. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV is performed to enhance the predictive performance of the model.

## Problem Statement
In the banking industry, customer churn prediction is crucial for customer retention strategies. Identifying customers who are likely to leave allows banks to take proactive measures to retain them, ultimately reducing revenue loss and improving customer satisfaction.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of various details of bank customers, including CustomerID, surname, credit score, and more. These attributes are used to train the machine learning model to predict customer churn.

## Models Used
- **XGBoost Classifier**: XGBoost is an efficient implementation of gradient boosting algorithms, which is highly effective for classification tasks.
- **GridSearchCV**: GridSearchCV is utilized for hyperparameter tuning, optimizing the XGBoost model's performance.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

## Learning Objectives
The primary objectives of this project include:
- Understanding the basics of supervised machine learning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques.
- Implementing XGBoost Classifier for classification tasks.
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

## Approach and Methodology
The project follows a systematic approach:
1. Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions, correlations, etc.
3. Model training: Training an XGBoost Classifier on the dataset.
4. Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizing model performance using GridSearchCV.

## Model Performance
The model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Scores. The effectiveness of the developed algorithm in predicting customer churn is assessed through these metrics.

## Impact
Predicting customer churn can significantly impact the banking industry by:
- Improving customer retention strategies.
- Minimizing revenue loss.
- Enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Future Enhancements
Future enhancements and experiments to improve model performance may include:
